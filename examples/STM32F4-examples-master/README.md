# STM32F4 Discovery example code

This repo contains example code for the STM32F4 Discovery board by ST Microelectronics

I have added a fixed Makefile which will enable the use of the math functions and sprintf()
and other libc functions from newlib.

Examples:

+ **GPIO** example featuring setting and reading from IO pins
+ **I2C** Master example showing how to transmit and receive data as a bus Master
+ **SPI** example on how to configure the SPI1 peripheral and transmit/receive data
+ **USART** example with receive interrupt
